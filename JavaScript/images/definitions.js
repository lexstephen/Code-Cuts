Constructors are methods. Like other methods, they can be overloaded. A public access modifier is always associated with constructors so that other classes can instantiate objects of their type. When you write a class, a constructor is automatically created for you if you do not explicitly define one. This one is called the default constructor . It has no functionality, other than the fact that it can be used to create an instance of the class. Default values are assigned to each member data field if the default constructor is used to create an object of the class type. No parameters are included with the default constructor .
